# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Course Project for CS412 @ UIUC. In collaboration with Ruowen Qin (UIUC) and Andrea Cui (UIUC)

## Introduction
This project aims to propose findings to combat fraudulent credit card transactions, an area attracting a lot of attention in the wake of massively growing credit card users, and consequently, growing fraudulent transactions. We divide the project into two streams, one that uses **sequential pattern mining** to obtain frequent patterns of transactions that lead to fraud cases, and the other that compares **predictive modeling techniques** that predict fraudulent transactions.
